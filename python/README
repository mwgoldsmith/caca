Pypycaca - libcaca bindings for Python
(c) 2006 Jean-Yves Lamoureux <jylam@lnxscene.org>


No warranty blaaah blaaah


These Python bindings will work with either Python 2.3 or 2.4, not tested previous versions.

Don't forget to change Makefile options in case you are not using Python 2.4.

No documentation yet, functions are all the same, with same arguments (using arrays or lists instead of C pointers, of course).

It hasn't been tested on anything else than IA32 yet.

I eat beef tonight, that was cool. Thanks.
